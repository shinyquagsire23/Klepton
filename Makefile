# NDKs reserve x18 as the ShadowCallStack platform register, so an Android target
# never allocates it and the payload would contain nothing to test. Beat Saber's
# libunity was built before that default changed, which is exactly why it has
# 14,536 x18 sites. -nostdlib keeps the payload free of libc so this stays a test
# of the loader and the veneer, not of the bionic shim.
