# Environment variables

Every environment variable the host tooling reads, found by grepping the C
sources for `getenv` and reading each usage site. Grouped by area. The source
is the authority; CLAUDE.md's knob table is a curated subset. Unless an entry
says otherwise, presence of the variable (any value, even empty-but-set for the
C `getenv` checks) turns the knob on, the default is off, and the reader is the
`t_boot` binary via the runtime it links.

## Boot / recon (`tests/t_boot.c`)

- `KL_RECON_CHILD=1` — marks the re-exec'd recon child, so `main` skips the
  guard test and the fork and goes straight to the guest run. Set by t_boot on
  itself across the `execl`; not meant to be set by hand.
- `KL_NOFORK=1` — run the recon in-process instead of in the re-exec'd child.
  Required under lldb (macOS lldb follows neither fork nor exec), at the cost
  of the AGX abort being masked by the debugger's signal traffic.
- `KL_SKIP_GUARD_TEST=1` — skip the DRM-guard self-test, which misreads under
  a debugger (the forked child's abort is intercepted and never reads as
  SIGABRT to `waitpid`). The guard in `kl_ovrplat.c` itself is unaffected.
- `KL_FAULT_WAIT=1` — park in t_boot's fault handler on SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/
  SIGABRT/SIGALRM and print the pid, for post-mortem `lldb -p` attach.
- `KL_LIFECYCLE=1` — drive the UnityPlayer lifecycle sequence
  (nativeRecreateGfxState, nativeResume, nativeRender) instead of stopping
  after initJni.
- `KL_FRAMES=N` — after the lifecycle, pump N `nativeRender` calls, ticking
  the Choreographer before each frame and draining the posted-task queue
  between them. One frame is engine setup and draws nothing. Default 0.
- `KL_ALARM=<s>` — the watchdog around each lifecycle call (default 20s) and
  around the whole frame pump (default 60s). Widen it when the question is
  what the guest is waiting on.
- `KL_PERMISSIVE=1` — unimplemented JNI/GL/OVRPlugin/OVRPlatform calls return
  0 instead of aborting. Read by `kl_jni.c` (via `kl_jni_set_permissive`),
  `kl_egl.c`, `kl_ovrp.c`, `kl_ovrplat.c`. Scouting only — the guest carries
  on with answers we invented. Does not apply to the DRM entitlement guard.

## GL / null driver (`runtime/kl_egl.c`)

- `KL_DUMP_SHADERS=<dir>` — after the frame pump, write every captured
  `glShaderSource` text into `<dir>`. Read by t_boot; the dump runs in
  `kl_egl.c`. The only place Unity's GLSL ES exists in plain text.
- `KL_DUMP_TEXTURES=<dir>` — write every uncompressed 8-bit
  `glTexSubImage2D` upload as a PNG under `<dir>`. Armed before the guest runs
  (uploads happen all through init). Compressed uploads (ETC2/ASTC) are
  skipped rather than guessed at.

## ANGLE reference renderer (`runtime/kl_glfb.c`)

All of these require `KL_GLFB=1` to mean anything; without it the null driver
answers GL and kl_glfb never initializes.

- `KL_GLFB=1` — enable the one-eye reference renderer on ANGLE/Metal.
  Host-only; it exists to produce the known-good frame a real backend gets
  diffed against.
- `KL_ANGLE_DIR=<dir>` — where to load `libEGL.dylib`/`libGLESv2.dylib` from.
  Default: `vendor/out/Debug` when its libEGL is present, else Google Chrome's
  framework Libraries dir. Also read by spikes s09, s10, s11.
- `KL_ANGLE_BACKEND=gl` — select ANGLE's OpenGL backend instead of Metal (the
  default, asked for by name). Only the exact string `gl` switches. Also read
  by spikes s09, s10, s11.
- `KL_GLFB_SIZE=WxH` — override the eye/pbuffer size (default 1832x1920, the
  Quest 2 per-eye size). Applied both at init and in `kl_glfb_set_size`.
- `KL_GLFB_SHARED=1` — per-thread ANGLE contexts sharing one object namespace,
  instead of the default single migrating root context. FBOs are not shared
  between contexts, so this mode renders nothing meaningful with this guest;
  it stays for the instruments built on it.
- `KL_GLFB_NOSHARE_OBJ=1` — with `KL_GLFB_SHARED`, give each thread a context
  that shares nothing. Answers whether a bug needs object sharing at all; the
  picture is meaningless.
- `KL_GLFB_PROBE=1` — run a trivial clear+readback on each guest thread as it
  takes a context, once. Answers whether the guest thread environment is
  poisoned. It clears the guest's framebuffer, so it is a probe, not a mode.
- `KL_GLFB_SELFTEST=1` — the same trivial GL on a plain host thread right
  after init. Answers "is the process poisoned".
- `KL_GLFB_DEBUG_CB=1` — register a KHR_debug callback (synchronous) on the
  root context and on each per-thread context, and print every message.
- `KL_GLFB_TRACE_TEX=1` — log every `glTexParameteri`/`glTexStorage*`/
  `glTexSubImage2D` call with arguments and a sequence number.
- `KL_GLFB_TRACE_FBO=1` — log the FBO lifecycle (`glGenFramebuffers`,
  `glBindFramebuffer`, `glFramebufferTexture2D`) with thread ids.
- `KL_GLFB_NOSRGB=1` — allocate `GL_RGBA8` where the guest asked for
  `GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8`. A probe; a captured frame is then wrong (un-decoded
  sRGB).
- `KL_GLFB_NOSWIZZLE=1` — drop the four `GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_*` parameters.
  Single-channel textures then sample as red; a probe only.
- `KL_GLFB_ERRPROBE=1` — bracket draws and blits with `glGetError` and print
  the first 20 with the state around them (draw FBO, program, viewport;
  `glCheckFramebufferStatus` on 0x506). Consumes the pending error. Also
  enables the blit-state log line.
- `KL_GLFB_DRAW_PROBE=1` — after each of the first 12 scene-sized draws (32+
  vertices), read back the centre 64x64 and report lit-pixel count and mean
  luma.
- `KL_GLFB_TEX_LIMIT=N` — perform only the first N `glTexSubImage2D` uploads
  and drop the rest; storage allocations still happen, so only texel contents
  go missing. Bisects the upload stream in situ. Default unlimited.
- `KL_GLFB_SKIP=<names>` — comma-separated GL entry points handed back to the
  null driver, so the ANGLE path is bisectable by family without a rebuild.
  Diagnostic only; the frame is wrong by construction.
- `KL_GLFB_TRACE=1` — log every GL call by name through the forwarding
  trampoline (`kl_gl_trace.S`).
- `KL_GLFB_TRACE_FROM=<n>` — start the `KL_GLFB_TRACE` printout at the nth
  call (default 0), so a crash deep in a long run stays readable.
- `KL_GLFB_LOCK=1` — route every resolved GL entry point through a
  process-wide lock held across the call (`kl_gl_lock.S`). Serialises all
  guest GL; a probe, not a mode.
- `KL_GLFB_OUT=<dir>` — request a PNG capture on each `eglSwapBuffers`. Read
  by `kl_egl.c`'s SwapBuffers; the readback is serviced from the next call the
  context-owning thread makes (or immediately when the swap arrives on that
  thread), because the swap itself does not.
- `KL_GLFB_OUT_EVERY=N` — throttle the PNG capture to every Nth swap (default
  1). Applies to the file path only; a registered frame sink gets every swap.

## Viewer (`runtime/kl_view.c`, `tests/t_boot.c`)

- `KL_VIEW=1` — interactive one-eye viewer on SDL3; WASD+mouse-look drives
  the head pose ovrp reports. Requires `KL_GLFB=1`, runs the guest in-process
  on a spawned thread (no guard test, no re-exec), and pumps frames until the
  window closes instead of `KL_FRAMES` times.

## Audio

No environment variables. `kl_opensl.c` reads none.

## x18 (`runtime/kl_x18.c`)

- `KL_X18=0` — disable x18 veneering (also `n`/`N`, matched on the first
  character). The survey counts sites either way, so an A/B run compares like
  with like. Default on.

## Signals / tracing

- `KL_TRACE_SIG=1` — log `sigaction`, `pthread_kill`, and `sem_post` (the
  first 12 posts) as the guest makes them. Read by `kl_libc.c` and
  `kl_pthread.c`.
- `KL_GUEST_SIGNALS=1` — install the guest's fatal-signal handlers (SIGSEGV,
  SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGTRAP, SIGSYS) instead of refusing them.
  Read by `kl_libc.c`. Default refuse: a guest handler expects a Linux
  ucontext and wedges inside Darwin's `_sigtramp`, costing every crash its
  diagnosis.
- `KL_TRACE_FS=1` — log every guest file op and its result; `=fail` logs only
  the failures. Read by `kl_libc.c`. Any other non-empty value means "all".
- `KL_TRACE_IMAGES=1` — log each loaded image's base and span, the stub pool
  mapping, and each emitted stub. Read by `kl_image.c`.

## Spikes (`spikes/`)

Standalone reproducers, not part of the runtime; each reads its own knobs.

- `S10_THREADS=N` — worker thread count (default 3).
- `S10_ITERS=N` — draw iterations per worker (default 4).
- `S10_STAGE=N` — stop after stage N (default 99, i.e. run everything).
- `S10_SHARE=0` — per-thread contexts share nothing (default 1, share with the
  root context).
- `S10_SERIAL=1` — hold a global lock across each thread's GL work (default 0).
- `S10_SWIZZLE=1` — run only the swizzled single-channel-texture stage, the
  guest's actual shape.
- `S10_REPLAY_ONLY=1` — run only the replay of the guest's texture sequence,
  skipping every other stage so a failure is attributable.
- `S10_EYE=1` — run only the eye-sized SRGB8_ALPHA8 FBO draw-and-blit stage.
- `S11_SIZE=WxH` — pbuffer size for s11_draw (default 1832x1920).

## Host environment pass-through

Not knobs — the shim reads these to answer the guest with host truth.

- `TMPDIR` — `kl_libc.c` builds the synthetic `/proc` tree under
  `$TMPDIR/klepton-proc.XXXXXX`, falling back to `/tmp/`.
- `LANG` — `kl_jni.c` derives `Locale.getDefault()`'s language and country
  from it (`en_US.UTF-8` becomes en/US). Empty, unset, or `C*` falls back to
  en/US.
