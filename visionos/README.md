# The visionOS host app

The Klepton app itself — PLANNING §12.6 (Swift for the platform layer) and
§12.7 (P4). `spikes/device-probe` stays what it is: a small, disposable thing
for answering device questions. This is the app those answers were for.

```bash
./run.sh              # the booted visionOS Simulator — rung 2, tests dyld
./run.sh device       # a physical Vision Pro         — rung 3, tests AMFI
```

Both do the same five steps: build the runtime (`make xros`), translate the
five guest libraries (`mkguest.sh`), regenerate the project, install, stage
assets, launch. `KL_SKIP_STAGE=1` skips the upload when the assets are already
there, which on device is the difference between a 20-second loop and a
20-minute one.

## What lives where, and why

|  | where | why |
|---|---|---|
| C runtime | `build/Klepton.xcframework`, linked **statically** | `make xros` builds both slices. Static, so it is inside the app binary — no load-time cost, and nothing for dyld to resolve. |
| guest libraries | `Frameworks/<name>.xcframework`, **embedded, not linked** | klepton-ld output. Embedded so Xcode code-signs them; a loose Mach-O elsewhere in the bundle is only *sealed* by the outer signature, which is not the same thing and is not what AMFI accepted in P3. Not *linked*, because nothing references their symbols — the runtime `dlopen`s them by path, and linking would make dyld want an exports trie klepton-ld deliberately does not emit. |
| APK assets (2.2 GB) | the app's **Documents container**, staged once | They change only when the APK does; the code changes every few minutes. Bundling them would put a multi-minute upload in front of every build. |

The asymmetry is deliberate: **code in the bundle, data in the container.** P3
established that AMFI accepts a `klepton-ld` dylib inside a bundle we signed,
and established nothing at all about one pushed into Documents afterwards.
Assets carry no code, so they have no such constraint.

## Language boundary

Swift owns the App, and will own the ImmersiveSpace, Compositor Services,
Metal and ARKit. C owns the guest. The seam is `Sources/kl_app.h` — four
functions — imported through `Sources/Klepton-Bridging-Header.h`. There is no
Objective-C anywhere and none is needed; see PLANNING §12.6 for why the
boundary lands there.

`Sources/kl_app.c` is `t_boot`'s sequence with the harness removed: no forked
DRM-guard self-test, no re-exec'd recon child (an app bundle never forks, and
the Metal-refuses-forked-children reason for it is moot once it does not), no
argv, no SDL viewer. What is left is load libmain → `JNI_OnLoad` →
`NativeLoader.load` → `UnityPlayer.initJni`.

## Reading a run

Everything the guest prints goes to `Documents/klepton-boot.log`,
**line-buffered** — an unimplemented JNI slot aborts the process by design, and
a fully-buffered stream loses the whole report when the process dies on a
signal. The UI polls the file while the run is going and offers it via
ShareLink afterwards; on the simulator it is easier to read straight off disk:

```bash
UDID=$(xcrun simctl list devices booted | grep -o '[0-9A-F-]\{36\}' | head -1)
LC_ALL=C less "$(xcrun simctl get_app_container $UDID dev.klepton.app data)/Documents/klepton-boot.log"
```

`LC_ALL=C` because the log contains guest bytes — the same trap as on the host.

## Gotchas that cost time here

- **Reinstalling rotates the data container.** Assets staged before an install
  end up in an orphaned container and the app reports them missing, which reads
  like a staging bug rather than an ordering one. `run.sh` stages *after*
  installing, always.
- **`$VAR…` is not `$VAR` followed by an ellipsis.** bash folds the multi-byte
  character into the variable name and dies with `unbound variable` on a name
  you never wrote. Brace it.
- **The archives need real Make prerequisites.** With only a `.PHONY` rule
  producing `build/xros/libklepton.a`, an edited runtime source left a stale
  archive, the xcframework was built from it, and the app silently ran the
  *previous* loader — which presents as a bug in the app. Fixed in the Makefile.
