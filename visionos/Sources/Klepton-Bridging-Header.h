// The whole C surface the Swift app sees.
//
// PLANNING §12.6: Swift owns the platform layer, C owns the guest, and the
// seam between them is a plain C header — no Objective-C anywhere. That is not
// an aesthetic choice, it is what keeps the boundary narrow: everything below
// is four functions, and the guest-facing complexity (JNIEnv, jobjects, ELF
// images) never crosses into Swift at all.
