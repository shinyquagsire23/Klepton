// Live controller-alignment tuning — the values in DEBUG_ENV_VARS.md's
// KL_SENSE_* and KL_XR_GRIP_* entries, made adjustable while wearing the
// headset instead of only at launch.
//
// **This exists because these numbers cannot be derived, only judged.** They
// are the gap between Apple's grip convention and the pose each guest was built
// against, and every guest applies its own controller-model transform on top —
// so the residual differs per title and the only instrument is a person looking
// at their hand. At a relaunch per candidate that is two minutes an iteration,
// which is why three targets were tuned by eye and none of them converged.
//
// The environment still sets the starting values, so a run that never opens the
// panel behaves exactly as it did before this file existed.
