// lands on the refusal by default, which is the direction an error should fall.
//
// What is covered and why:
//   Entitle*  — "is this user allowed to run this", the licence check. Note the
//               g_plat_absent carve-out below: the APP's own entitlement is
//               answered, everything else in the family still refuses.
//   IAP       — purchases and their ownership records.
//   AssetFile — download and unlock of purchasable DLC; the delivery half of the
//               same question. ovr_AssetFile_* is how paid content arrives.
//               Note the g_plat_absent carve-out above: the pure *enumeration*
//               call is answered with "nothing here", which grants no access.

// neither reason generalises to the rest of the family — which is why these are
// exact names, not substrings, and are checked BEFORE the markers below, so the
// marker list keeps its fail-closed default and anything new still lands on the
// refusal.
//
//   ovr_AssetFile_GetList — enumerates the DLC asset files present on this
//     device. There are none, and saying so is a fact about this host rather
//     than a licence decision. It unlocks nothing and is strictly MORE
//     restrictive than the truth: no content is reachable through a run that
//     answers it which was not reachable through a run that aborted on it. It
//     carries no entitlement flag — the ownership question is asked by the
//     Entitlement/IAP families, and everything that could DELIVER content
//     (ovr_AssetFile_Download*) stays refused.
//
//   ovr_Entitlement_GetIsViewerEntitled — the APPLICATION's own licence check,
//     and the one question in this family we can actually answer. Klepton runs
//     an APK the user unpacked from a device they own, i.e. from a copy of the
//     app they already bought; answering yes describes that, it does not
//     manufacture it. This is a deliberate move of the line and it is confined
//     to the app: DLC ownership stays refused because it is genuinely
//     unanswerable here — paid content is out-of-band asset data plus a licence
//     held by a platform that is absent from this host, so neither half is
//     present to check, and claiming it IS the circumvention. It is answered
//     for real (klplat_Entitlement_GetIsViewerEntitled) rather than through the
//     request path below, because it returns its answer directly.
//
// The remaining entries are answered through klplat_init_fails, i.e. request id
// 0: the platform request APIs are asynchronous and ovr_PopMessage never
// produces a message, so a plausible id would leave the caller polling forever
// for a completion that cannot come. 0 puts it on the error path it already has.

// The completion queue — an asynchronous request has to ARRIVE somewhere

// point here answered `ovrRequest` 0 under a comment saying that a plausible id
// "would be a lie with a tail: the caller would then poll ovr_PopMessage
// forever for a completion that cannot come". The measurement says **0 has the
// same tail**: the SDK builds its `Request` object either way and awaits it, so
// what 0 bought was not an error path but silence.
//
// 1.40 gates a screen on that silence. Its `HealthWarningFlowCoordinator` hands
// the epilepsy screen's Continue to `WaitForUserAgeCategory`, a coroutine
// waiting on a category that `OculusInit.CheckUserAgeCategoryAsync` never sets
// because `InitializeOculusAsync` is still awaiting the platform init — so the
// button did nothing, silently, with the frame loop running normally. The whole
// visible symptom was one un-delivered message.
//
// **What is asserted here, and by whose decision.** Answering the age category
// at all means claiming an initialized platform, which is a real change from
// "genuinely absent" — an absent platform cannot answer a demographic question.
// The user asked for it and declared themselves over 18 (2026-08-12), which is
// the only place that answer can legitimately come from here: it is a
// self-declaration by the person running their own copy, not a fact we
// discovered. **The DRM line does not move with it** — IAP, purchase records,
// asset details and every delivery call still abort unconditionally, and
// `check_drm_guard` still asserts both directions. What changes is that the
// application's own entitlement, already answered yes, is now answered through
// the channel the guest actually reads.
//
// The three completions are all this queues, and each is issued only in
// response to the guest's own request:
//
//   ovr_UnityInitWrapperAsynchronous  -> Platform_InitializeAndroidAsynchronous,

//   ovr_UserAgeCategory_Get           -> UserAgeCategory_Get, category Ad(ult)
//
// **The numbers are the guest's own**, read out of the running IL2CPP runtime
// with `KL_PROBE_ENUM` (kl_mprobe.c) rather than taken from an SDK header we do
// not have — the same move as OVRP_HEADSET_OCULUS_QUEST_2 in kl_ovrp.c, and
// necessary rather than tidy: `Message.ParseMessageHandle` switches on the type
// and its `default` arm logs "Unrecognized message type" and produces NO

// answer that is NOT safe here: the guest would carry a NULL through to the
// setters, and on a real platform that is a null deref inside the library.

// We hand back a non-NULL cookie instead. Nothing reads it: the setters are
// no-ops because the request the options would feed cannot be made anyway
// (ovr_GroupPresence_Set and friends answer 0 above), so there is no state
// worth keeping and one shared cookie serves every live options object. That
// is invented behaviour in the narrow sense, but it invents no ANSWER — the
// guest learns nothing from it that it did not itself put in.
//
// Entitlement spellings never reach here: plat_is_drm runs first, so
// ovr_IAPOptions_* and the rest still refuse.
// Outbound-only calls: the guest hands us something and asks nothing back.
