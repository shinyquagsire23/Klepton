// worked". `ovrpBool` is a plain boolean, so 0 is "no" — and for a getter like
// ovrp_GetInitialized that reads as "XR never came up", which is the answer we
// are specifically trying not to give.
//
// So there is no single permissive value. Entry points are placed in one of two
// named lists by which type they return, and anything in neither still aborts by
// name. Getting this wrong is the trap-6d failure again: a silent zero that reads
// as a legitimate negative answer several layers from where it was invented.
